To create a speed typing test application in Python, you can use the time module to measure the time it takes for a user to type a given string, and then compare that time to the user's average typing speed to calculate their words per minute (WPM) score.

This code will prompt the user to type the given input string as quickly as possible, and then calculate their WPM score based on the time it takes them to type the string and the number of words in the string. You can modify the input string and the calculation of the WPM score to suit your needs.
